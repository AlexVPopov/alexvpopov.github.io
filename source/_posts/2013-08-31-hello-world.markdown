## A post to get my blog going

This is it. I made it. I installed [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), deployed my blog on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and am writing my first blog post. I decided to create this blog for two reasons:

1. I spend a lot of time solving problems in the course of my learning, in the course of my work, in the course of my life in general. This costs time. I want to share my knowledge and spare the time of other people. Octopress happens to be a beautiful and very flexible way to do this.
2. Blogging on Octopress involves many technologies, such as [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Jakyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) (obviously), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and many more. I like using inovative and beautiful technologies and I like learning.

So there you have it. I promise to try and blog at least once a week and hope my posts will help you doing the things you like to do faster and easier.

P.S. Although this blog will be primarily tech-oriented, I might also write about other interesting stuff from all corners of life.
