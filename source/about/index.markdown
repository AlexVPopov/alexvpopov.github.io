My name is Alex and I am a Ruby on Rails enthusiast. I think it makes sense to tell here how I got to where I am now in terms of my technical (and to some extent professional) interests and what I plan to do in the future. 

The whole idea about me getting into the programming business is that I have always had some (from my point of view) great ideas, but have lacked the tools to make them a reality. So I decided that I will I started my learning path in the programming world with [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) by [Zed Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/#/start). This was a good start, but as a complete newby I was overwhelmed by the huge number of online resources. I didn't know what was important, what was not that much and what I needed to spend more time on. In short - I needed structure. For a more organized approach I enrolled in the __*free*__ [Telerik Academy](http://academy.telerik.com/) (I won't go into details about the Academy, as there will be a dedicated post about it). The Academy gave me great fundamentals of programming in C#. 

At some point, though I really started planning to put into action some of my ideas. I needed a language/framework that is:

* good for web applications;
* easy to learn;
* well supported with a good community around it (so I could easily find answers to questions I might come up with);
* preferably open-source and (relatively) not expensive to deploy;

This boiled it down to two options: [Python/Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) vs. [Ruby/Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). I spent quite some time researching which of the two is better. Though I saw some hardcore fans of both camps, many people agreed that both frameworks are great and I couldn't go wrong with neither of them. There was no clear winner I had to decided based on my needs and criteria. Ulimately, I decided to go with Ruby on Rails. The reason for this is because I think RoR is a bit easier to learn than Django. In Rails the leading principle is convention over configuration - there are reasonable defaults for everything and you need to do something only if you want to acomplish something specific, whereas in Django you need to specify everything explicitly. Furthermore, I really liked the idea of a central managing system for packages - rubygems - and the plentifulness of good community solutions for various things. Last but not  -least, I really liked the vibrant RoR community - always ready to help and ready to experiment and implement cutting-edge technologies.

So there I am know - working on the famous [Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/) and taking the brilliant [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) courses on Rails, JavaScript and others. As mentioned in my first [Hello World](/blog/2013/08/31/hello-world/), I will mostly write about problems, the solution of which is not so straightforward in order to try and make the life of other fellow folks easier. I will also publish my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems as an attempt to better my knowledge in Ruby syntax and algorithms. Occasionally, I will write about non-technical topics.

Finally, a few words about my favourite technologies/products: I develop Ruby on Rails on OS X Mountain Lion at work and Ubuntu 13.04 at home, my text editor is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), my console is [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), I use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control, I sync files across devices with [SugarSync](https://www.sugarsync.com/int/referral/index.html?utm_medium=web&utm_source=website&utm_campaign=referral&referralCode=btwie0j9vbbm6&shareEvent=6477529&displayName=avp3000%40gmail.com&displayBetaBanner=true&gse=false) and [UbuntuOne](https://one.ubuntu.com/referrals/referee/3409899/) (spoiler - referrel links) and use [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for blogging.
